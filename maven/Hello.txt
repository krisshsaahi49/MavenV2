In hashing there is a hash function that maps keys to some values. But these hashing function may lead to collision that is two or more keys are mapped to same value. Chain hashing avoids collision. The idea is to make each cell of hash table point to a linked list of records that have same hash function value.

Let’s create a hash function, such that our hash table has ‘N’ number of buckets.
To insert a node into the hash table, we need to find the hash index for the given key. And it could be calculated using the hash function.
